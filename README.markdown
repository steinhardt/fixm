fixm
====

`fixm` is a script which scans a local directory and counts the instances of the flag "FIXME". The script then posts the results to a Twitter account.

*N.B.*: Like [watermarker](https://github.com/steinhardt/watermarker), this script is just a little thing that I'm writing to self-learn Perl. So I know it's pretty badly written.
